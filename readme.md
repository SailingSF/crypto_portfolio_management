This repo is for code I mainly use in python notebooks to do portfolio analysis and optimization for crypto strategies. I have consolidated the relavant functions with some examples into .py files and may also include example notebooks.

On my machine I really use them as notbooks and test individual cells but I believe some of the functions may have relavance to other's work and it's much more efficient to share things I've done this way rather than have someone try to decipher my messy notebooks.
