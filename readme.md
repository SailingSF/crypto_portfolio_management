# Portfolio Management for Crypto

This repo is for code I mainly use in python notebooks to do portfolio analysis and optimization for crypto strategies. I have consolidated the relavant functions with some examples into .py files and will also include example notebooks.

On my machine I really use them as true notbooks and test individual cells and generally have no coherent order, but I believe some of the functions I use may have relavance to other's work. This is also a much more efficient way to share things rather than have someone try to decipher my messy notebooks. There is also the added benefit that organizing my function and thoughts into scripts with examples helps me organize my own code.
